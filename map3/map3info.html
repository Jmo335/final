       <p>This generated point cloud data displays the area in which I was born and raised.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>If you position youself at each point, you can get a general idea of what kind of view you will have from a front or back porch.</p>
       <p>This also gives an idea of driveway placement to gain convenient access to the house. I can associate the desired driveway placement with the changes in elevation from my contour map and the profile view from the potree map.</p>
       <p>The majority of the property was owned by my grandfather and grandmother, Then to my father and his siblings. A part is now mine and will one day be my sons.</p>
       <p>The portion that is mine, is mostly hills and the flat on top that would be hard to access.</p>
       <p>The maps I have created and the knowledge I have gained from this course, may one day help me in the developement of this property into a beautiful place to call home.</p>
