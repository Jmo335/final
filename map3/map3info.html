       <p>This generated point cloud data displays the area in which I was born and raised.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>If you click the annotations labeled point 1 and point 2, you can get an idea of what kind of view you will have from a front or back porch.</p>
       <p>This also gives an idea of driveway placement to gain convenient access to either site. I can associate the desired driveway placement with the change in elevation from my contour map and the profile view from the potree map.</p>
       <p>The majority of the property was owned by my grandfather and grandmother, Then to my father and his siblings. A part is now mine and will one day be my sons.</p>
       <p>The portion that is mine, is mostly hills and the flat on top that would be hard to access.</p>
       <p>These maps and the knowledge I have obtained throughout this course, may one day help me in the developement of this property, pontentially into a beautiful place we can call home.</p>
