       <p>This generated point cloud data displays the area in which I was born and raised.</p>
       <p>As you zoom in to the point of interested as specified in the previous maps, you can navigate up the hill to the ridge top and see all of geographic features associate with the terrain.</p>
       <p>If you position youself at any point on top of the ridge, you can get a general idea of what kind of view you will have from a front or back porch.</p>
       <p>This also gives an idea of driveway placement to gain convenient access to the house. I can associate the desired driveway placement with the changes in elevation from my contour map.</p>
       <p>The majority of the property was owned by my grandfather and grandmother, my father owned one third after their passing and left it to me after his.</p>
       <p>The portion that is mine, is mostly hills and the flat on top of the ridge.</p>
       <p>The maps I have created and the knowledge I have gained from this course, may one day help me in the developement of this property into a beautiful place to call home.</p>
