        <p>My name is Jerry Montgomery, I am from a small rural area of Eastern Kentucky.</p>
        <p>This project is a final for GEO 409 Advanced GIS class, I was asked to choose an area of interest and make maps about that particular area using the information I have gathered throughout the course.</p>
        <p>This area is located in Magoffin County, Kentucky.</p>
        <p>I have gathered lidar and other map data from the sources used throughout the course.</p>
        <p>I have a work history in construction and am currently a Civil Engineering major.</p>
        <p>I will attempt to relate this project to my work history, major, and to myself personally.</p>
        <p>The area circled is my particular area of interest.</p>
        <p>The points on the map will be defined as point 1 and point 2.</p>
