        <p>My name is Jerry Montgomery, I am from a small rural area of Eastern Kentucky.</p>
        <p>This project is a final for GEO 409 Advanced GIS, I was asked to choose an area of interest and make maps about that particular area using the information I have gathered throughout the course.</p>
        <p>This area is located in Magoffin County, Kentucky.</p>
        <p>I have gathered GIS and other map data from the sources used throughout the course.</p>
        <p>I have a work history in construction and am currently a Civil Engineering major.</p>
        <p>I will relate this project as best I can, to both my work history, major, and to me personally.</p>
        <p>The area circled is my area of interest.</p>
        <p>The BLUE point and BLACK point on the map will be defined as point A and point B.</p>
