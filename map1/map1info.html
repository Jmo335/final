       <p>This is a hillshade map for my area of interest.</p>
       <p>This map is generated from point cloud data that was filtered to display only ground points.</p>
       <p>The map displays a scale bar to give us reference on map scale and distance.</p>
       <p>There are two points, one blue and one black.</p>
       <p>These points will represent my two points of interest.</p>
       <p>I want to determine the best view from either of these points looking from atop the ridge.
       <p>Also, the most efficient and the safest placement of a road to go up the hill and access these points.</p>
       <p>Following the point of the South arrow is a road, this road forks and goes directly below the two points of interest.</p>
       <p>Obviously our choice for a road to Point A or B will connect to this road.</p>
       <p>There are also pictures from point A and point B below the map, showing us the view from each point.</p>
