        <p>This is a contour map that is hosted by MapBox and is concentrated around my area of interest.</p>
        <p>The map showcases contour lines that can be interpreted to gauge where to cut and fill dirt.</p>
        <p>This can help make a decision on where to remove dirt and also help determine where to place it.</p>
        <p>The idea of constructing a road to help ascend this hill will indeed be a task, the idea of visualizing these slopes with the presence of contours is really helpful. </p>
